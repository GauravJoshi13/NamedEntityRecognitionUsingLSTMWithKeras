# Named Entity Recognition using LSTMs with Keras

Now we will build and train a bi-directional LSTM neural network to recognize named entities in text data. We will accomplish it by completing each task in the project:

**Task 1**:  Project Overview and Import Modules

**Task 2**: Load and Explore the NER Dataset

**Task 3**: Retrieve Sentences and Corresponding Tags

**Task 4**: Define Mappings between Sentences and Tags

**Task 5**: Padding Input Sentences and Creating Train/Test Splits

**Task 6**: Build and Compile a Bidirectional LSTM Model

**Task 7**: Train the Model

**Task 8**:  Evaluate Named Entity Recognition Model
